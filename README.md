The dataset for this competition has been meticulously collected. The input data is text-based but the code for transforming it to a set of features is provided. Changes to feature selection process are welcomed.

Data contains information about Pokemon moves, the actions that Pokemon can do in a battle. move_name is the data identifier, flavor_text is the input data and damageclass is target label. Train data will provide all information while test data will not provide target label.

Your objective is to write a python code for classifying flavor_text into damageclass.
